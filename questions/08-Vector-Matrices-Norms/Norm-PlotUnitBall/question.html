<h1>Norms</h1>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> In addition to regular $p$-norms, we will use the "0.5-norm" below. By
    this we mean that you should use the expression for the $p$-norm with $p=0.5$.
    Note that this is not actually a norm.
  </p>
<h2>Your task:</h2>
<p>With respect to each norm, plot a 2D ball with radius <code>r</code> centered around the origin using 500 points. (That is, plot the ball made of all 2D vectors $w$ that satisfy the equation $|w|_p=$<code>r</code> for the $p$-norm.)</p>
<p>Save a plot's axes using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.gca.html">plt.gca()</a>. For example:</p>
<pl-code language="python">
plt.figure()
# ...code for the plot...
fig_1 = plt.gca()</pl-code>
<p>Your code should produce the following four plots:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw the radius <code>r</code> 2D ball with respect to the 1-norm and save the plot to <code>fig_1</code>.</li>
<li>Draw the radius <code>r</code> 2D ball with respect to the 2-norm and save the plot to <code>fig_2</code>.</li>
<li>Draw the radius <code>r</code> 2D ball with respect to the 5-norm and save the plot to <code>fig_3</code>.</li>
<li>Draw the radius <code>r</code> 2D ball with respect to the "0.5-norm" and save the plot to <code>fig_4</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I make multiple figures?</strong></p>
<p>Call <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html">plt.figure()</a> at the start of each new figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I draw a ball (with respect to norm $|\cdot|$) with radius <code>r</code>?</strong></p>
<p>First, generate 500 points that are equispaced in $[0, 2\pi]$.
        Use these points to generate vectors in the unit ball whose angle corresponds to the generated points.
        Then scale the vectors such that $|\cdot| = $<code>r</code>.
      </p>
<p>
        To scale the vectors to have the right norm, simply compute their norm and scalar-multiply the vectors by the inverse of the norm, so that they have $|\cdot|=1$.
        Then scalar multiply them by <code>r</code>.
      </p>
<p>Then plot these scaled points using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html">plt.plot()</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My circles aren't circles. Help!</strong></p>
<p>That's not a question, but we understand. Use <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_aspect.html">plt.gca().set_aspect('equal')</a> to get an aspect ratio of 1:1 in the plots (so the shape of the plots looks appropriate).</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Specifying a radius of ball doesn't imply that the ball will be a circle.
        It simply means that the vectors will have $|\cdot|= $<code>r</code>.
        The shape of the ball is entirely dependent on the norm used.
        Also, make sure that when plotting you use the results of $cos(\phi)$ as the "x" coordinates.
