    You are developing a new electronic device for which it is critical to know
    how much power each of its 10 components uses.
  </p>
<p>
    You find you can not directly measure the power use of each component. 
    Instead, you can only measure how much energy the
    entire device uses and the duration for which each component operates. (<em>Exemplī grātiā</em>:
    The device consumed 5 millijoules with the microphone operating for 1 second and
    the screen for 0.5 seconds.) Your goal is to calculate the energy consumed
    per second by each component on the device. You will do this by setting up
    and solving a linear system.
  </p>
<p>You are given a Python dictionary called <code>test_data</code> containing
    measurements from 10 different tests. Each test is stored as a Python list of tuples
    (<em>e.g.</em> <code>[('LED0', 0.58), ('Screen', 0.24), ('EnergyConsumed', 1.2), ...]</code>).
    The tuple with first entry equal to <code>'EnergyConsumed'</code> is the energy consumed by
    the device on that test. The other tuples indicate the length of time each component operated.
  </p>
<p>
    You are also given a Python list of the component IDs called <code>components</code>.
    Using these two inputs, build a linear system $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$ to solve for the rate of energy use
    of each component. You may use <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code> to solve your
    linear system. Return <code>power_usage</code> with entries corresponding to the same order as they show
    up in <code>components</code> (i.e. if <code>'Screen'</code> is the first string in <code>components</code> then
    the first entry of <code>power_usage</code> should be the amount of energy per second that <code>'Screen'</code>
    consumes).

<p> The setup code provides the following variables: </p>
