        The Parks and Rec department has an opening for a <i>Solver of Linear Equations</i>.
        Since Leslie is great at solving systems of linear equations she zealously offers to give all candidates a quick demonstration.</p>
<p>
        She finds the LU factorization of a ${{params.n0}} \times {{params.n0}}$ matrix ${\bf M}$ in {{params.t0}} seconds.
        She then takes another {{params.t1}} seconds to apply both triangular substitutions (backward and forward)
         to solve the system of equations ${\bf M x} = {\bf y}$ for a given vector ${\bf y}$.
    </p>
<p>
      The candidates are supposed to estimate (without actually running any code)
      the time it takes to factorize
      and efficiently solve a similar system of linear equations
      ${\bf A x} = {\bf b}$, where ${\bf A}$ is a square matrix with dimension ${{params.n1}}$, given
      ${{params.b}}$ different right-hand side ${\bf b}$ vectors.
      Provide your time estimate $t$ in the answer box below.

        <!-- As Leslie's assistant, you don't think the department needs
        to hire a new person since you know how to solve similar system of linear equations
        $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a square matrix and $b$ has ${{params.n1}}$ rows.
        Based on Leslie's demonstration, how much time $t$ it takes to factorize
        and efficiently solve for ${{params.b}}$ different $b$ vectors? -->
