<p>Numerical methods are implementations of mathematical algorithms, but
constructed with special consideration for accuracy of solutions and
computational run-time.</p>
<p>The order in which we implement floating point arithmetic for any numerical
method will effect the accuracy of the final computed value.
For this reason, extra thought must be placed on our basic mathematical operations.</p>
<p>In this problem, you are asked to add-up the values in a large array called <code>data</code>.
How should you do this to achieve the most accurate final sum?
Return your summation as a floating point variable named <code>data_sum</code>.</p>
<p>The values and size of <code>data</code> will vary in length, so make sure your code
is written in a generic fashion to handle this aspect.</p>
<p> The setup code gives the following variable: </p>
<pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_for_user"></pl-external-grader-variables>
<p> Your code snippet should define the following variable: </p>
<pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user"></pl-external-grader-variables>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> <code>data</code> can contain negative numbers as well.
