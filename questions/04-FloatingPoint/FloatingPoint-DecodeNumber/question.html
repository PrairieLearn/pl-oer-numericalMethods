  Suppose that you are a computer engineer implementing hardware to decode an 8-bit "minifloat" floating point number.
  Every floating point number in this system is normalized, such that a floating point number $a$ is
  written as $a = (-1)^s \times (1.M) \times 2^E$. $s$ represents the sign bit, which is bit 0 of the 8-bit floating point number.
  $E$ represents the exponent field, which is bits 1-4 of the floating point number. $E$ is written in excess 8 encoding,
  which means that converting bits 1-4 into a base-10 integer and subtracting 8 gives the exponent. $M$ represents the significand, which
  are bits 5-7 in the floating point number.
  </p>
<p>
    For example, if you have <code>[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]</code> as your input minifloat number, your exponent is converting $1110$ to base 10 and minus 8, which is $14 - 8 = 6$.
    Your significant should be $1.000$. Therefore you should output $(-1)^{1} \times (1.000) \times 2^6 = -64$.
  </p>
<p>
  Write a short program to decode a list of 8-bit "minifloat" numbers, stored in <code>minifloats</code>, into a list of Python <code>float</code>s.
  Each "minifloat" is a numpy array of 1's and 0's.
  Store each decoded <code>float</code> in <code>outputs</code>, a list of floating point numbers.
