    You are applying for jobs in the financial industry, looking for a position applying numerical methods in the field of financial modeling.  An interviewer tells you about the 1982 rounding error in the Vancouver Stock Exchange's index, in which the error caused a 50 percent loss of value in 22 months.  The interviewer decides to determine your knowledge of floating-point representations with a quick test.
    </p>
<p>
    You are asked to represent the number $y = {{params.decimal_f}}$ in a floating-point system that contains numbers of the form
    </p>
<p>
    $$x = {{params.fp_format}},$$
    </p>
<p>
    with $b_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and exponent $m \in {{params.exp_range}}$.  What is the absolute error $|y - \text{fl}(y)|$ due to rounding if the floating point system <strong>{{params.rounding}}</strong>?
