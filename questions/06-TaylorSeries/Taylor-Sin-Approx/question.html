    Recall that a function $f(x)$ can be expressed 
    as a Taylor Series <em>centered</em> at a number $x_0$:

    $$
    f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n
    $$
  </p>
<p>
    which can be truncated at any integer $N$ to approximate $f(x)$ 
    with varying levels of accuracy. 
    Usually, the closer $x$ is to $x_0$, the better the truncated series 
    approximates $f(x)$.

    Below is a plot of $\sin(x)$, $f(x) = x$, and
    the $n=3$ Taylor series expansion of $\sin(x)$.

    Often $f(x) = x$ is used to approximate $\sin(x)$.
    You can verify that this is the first nonzero term of the Taylor series of
    $\sin(x)$ about $x_0 = 0$.
    This estimate is valid only in a small neighborhood near $x=0$. We want to
    examine its behavior at points progressively further 
    from the center of the Taylor series for a particular value of $\hat{x} = 0.7$:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the $n = 1$ and $n = 3$ Taylor series expansions of $\sin(x)$
    about $x_0 = 0$ evaluated at $\hat{x}$.</li>
<li>Calculate the $n = 3$ Taylor series expansion of $\sin(x)$ about
    $x_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}$ evaluated at $\hat{x}$.</li>
<li>Calculate the true value of $\sin(\hat{x})$. Use this value
    to calculate the relative errors of the approximations. Save the results
    in <code>err_0_1</code>, <code>err_0_3</code>, and <code>err_pi4_3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember that the formula for relative error is
    $\left|\frac{y_{approx} - y_{true}}{y_{true}}\right|$.
