    Suppose you want to use the normal equation to solve for the coefficients of a least square problem. The equation you
    want to fit is a degree $k$ polynomial of the following format:
  </p>
<p>
    $$y = c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + ... + c_k x^k$$
  </p>
<p>If the dataset you try to fit consists of the following ${{params.m}}$ data points:
    $$\begin{array}{l|{{params.cm}}}
    x &amp; {{params.x}} \\
    \hline
    y &amp; {{params.y}} \\
    \end{array}$$

    What is the maximum degree $k$ of the polynomial such that the least square problem still
    has a unique solution?
