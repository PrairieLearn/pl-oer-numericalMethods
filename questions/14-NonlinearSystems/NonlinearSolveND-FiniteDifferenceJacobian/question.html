<pl-answer correct="true">
    The finite-difference approximation is useful if the partial
    derivatives of the function are expensive
  </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="true">
    The finite-difference approximation can be computed even if the
    partial derivatives of the function are unknown
  </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    The finite-difference approximation can usually be factorized
    more quickly than the true Jacobian
  </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    Newton's method converges quadratically whether or not a finite
    difference approximation is used
