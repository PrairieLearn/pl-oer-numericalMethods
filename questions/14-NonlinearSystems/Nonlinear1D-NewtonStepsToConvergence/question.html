<p>
        Given a starting guess of $x_0 = {{params.x0}}$, how many steps of Newton's method
        must you take to approximate the root of $f(x) = {{params.equation}}$
        to a residual tolerance of ${{params.tolerance}}$?  The residual here is <i>how close</i> the solution is to being a root and is defined as $\left\lvert f(x) \right\rvert$.
    </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You need to carry out the iteration to solve this question.</p>
