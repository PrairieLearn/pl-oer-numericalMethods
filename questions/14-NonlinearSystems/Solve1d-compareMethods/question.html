<pl-answer correct="true">
    Newton's method can achieve quadratic convergence, but requires
    knowledge of the derivative $f'(x)$.
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="true">
    Secant method is only locally convergent
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    Newton's method requires two starting guesses.
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    The Secant method is quadratically convergent, and doesn't require
    knowledge of the derivative $f'(x)$.
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    The Bisection method offers superlinear (i.e. faster than linear)
	convergence as long as $f'(a) \neq 0$ at the exact solution $x=a$.
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="true">
    The computational cost for Bisection and Secant method are roughtly the same while Secant method offers better convergence rate.
    </pl-answer>
<br/>
<pl-answer correct="true">
    The Bisection method can always find a root for continuous functions given the starting interval $[a, b]$ where $sgn(f(a)) = - sgn(f(b))$.
