<pl-answer correct="true">
    	Newton's method usually converges faster than bisection method. 
	</pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    	Newton's method will find an (approximate) solution of $f(x)=0$
    	irrespective of the starting guess $x_0$.
    </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    	A step in Newton's method can always be carried out
    	for any smooth function and any value of the current guess
    	$x_k$.

<pl-answer correct="false">
    	It will always converge quadratically.
    </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    	It will always converge quadratically or linearly.
    </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="true">
    	It may converge quadratically, linearly, or not converge at all.
    </pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct="false">
    	It will either converge quadratically or not converge at all - no other outcome is possible.
