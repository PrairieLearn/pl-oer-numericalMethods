<h4> Problem Setup </h4>

      The Monte Carlo method is commonly used to approximate areas or volumes of
      shapes. In this problem, we will use Monte Carlo to find the area of a circle,
      allowing us to estimate the value of $\pi$. Furthermore, we will use several
      different sample sizes to see how the accuracy increases with larger samples.

<h4>Implementation</h4>
<h5>Part 1</h5>
<p>  According to the formula $A = \pi r^2$, for a circle of radius 1, the area
      of the circle will be equal to $\pi$. Therefore, if we can use Monte Carlo
      to approximate the area of the circle, we can find an estimate for $\pi$. </p>
<p>
    Write a function <code>calculate_pi</code> that accepts a sample of x and corresponding y coordinates
    as arguments and returns an estimate for $\pi$ (since we want to calculate $\pi$ for various
    sample sizes, it will be useful for it to be a function).
    To simplify things, we will only consider
    a single quadrant of the unit circle (see gif above). Therefore, the area
    of the full circle will be 4 times the area we calculate for the single
    quadrant (and your function should take this into account).
    </p>
<h5>Part 2</h5>
<p>
      Using the <code>calculate_pi</code> function you wrote in Part 1, estimate the value
      of $\pi$ for different sample size of powers of 10 ranging from $10^0$ to $10^6$ (inclusive). Store
      these values in an array of size 7 named <code>pi</code>. The samples has been given to you in
      <code>xs</code> and <code>ys</code>. For example, if you need 10 samples, you may use
      <code>xs[:10]</code> to get the x coordinates of these 10 samples.
    </p>
<h5>Part 3</h5>
<p>
      Plot the absolute error of your approximations vs. the sample size on a
      log-log plot. The error can be obtained by subtracting the true value of
      $\pi$ from your approximations. Provide appropriate axes labels and a title.
      Save your plot to a variable <code>plot</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      You should notice that the error decreases with larger sample sizes,
      although there may be a considerable amount of noise due to randomization.
      The order of convergence of Monte Carlo is $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$, so the slope
      of your plot should be around $-1/2$.
